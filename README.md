# Operating Systems Coursework Repository

## Overview
This repository contains my coursework for the Operating Systems course. It encompasses three main projects: a simple system call program in C, an analysis of various page replacement methods, and a multi-threaded server for file transfers and keyword frequency analysis.

### 1. System Call in C
This section of the repository includes a simple C program demonstrating the use of system calls. The objective is to gain hands-on experience with low-level programming and the interaction between user-space and kernel-space.

- **Key Concepts**: System Calls, C Programming, Kernel/User Space Interaction.

### 2. Page Replacement Methods Analysis
The second project focuses on analyzing the hit rate of different page replacement algorithms. By comparing these methods with the optimal algorithm, the aim is to understand their efficiency in various scenarios.

- **Key Concepts**: Page Replacement Algorithms, Hit Rate Analysis, Memory Management.
- **Tools Used**: Python for data processing and analysis.

### 3. Multi-Threaded Server for File Transfer and Keyword Analysis
This project involves developing a server that handles file transfers and keyword frequency analysis concurrently using multi-threading.

#### Description:
- Implemented a multi-threaded server in C and Python capable of managing concurrent file transfers.
- Developed a keyword frequency analysis tool to compute the occurrence rates of specified terms across all transferred files.
- Employed semaphores and mutex locks to ensure thread-safe operations during file transfer and data analysis.
- Devised an algorithm for ranking keywords, providing insights into keyword significance and document relevancy.

#### Achievements:
- Efficient concurrent file transfers on a local network.
- Robust keyword frequency analysis with real-time data processing.
- Thread synchronization for data integrity using semaphores and mutex locks.
- Ranking algorithm for analyzing and presenting processed data.

#### Technologies Used:
- Multi-threading in C and Python for parallel file transfers and data processing.
- Semaphore and mutex lock mechanisms for thread synchronization.
- Custom-built keyword frequency analyzer for file corpus analysis.
- Efficient sorting algorithm for data ranking and analysis.
